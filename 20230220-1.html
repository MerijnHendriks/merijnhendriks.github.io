The white walls surround me. Doors labeled with numbers. Steps reverb in the hallway. Man and woman in white dresses and coats passing by. A soft ambient humming from the air purifier. &quot;Where is it again?&quot;, I check the note in my pocket. Room 243. A burning chill goes down my spine. Breath turned cold, fatigue hitting me. I really don't want to go.</p> <p>The woman besides the entrance greets me. &quot;You only got 10 minutes&quot;. I gave her a nod, grabbed the knob and opened the door. I take off all my cloths in the dressing room, decontaminate the freshly bought cloths from the local store and proceed to take a shower. Once dressed up, I enter the room.</p> <p>A relatively small woman besides the window on the bed, dressed in a white pajama covered by a white blanket. With a heavy but gentle smile she greeted me. &quot;Welcome back&quot;. Her blue eyes shine brightly like diamonds reflect the stars. The little strength I had fades away. I fall to my knees in front of the bed by her side, and cry as I hold her hand. The ashes fade slowly as she holds me, the tears fall down as she consoles me. We both know what will happen next. I kiss her lips deeply as I hold her hair gently. Wanting to hold on, knowing we have to let go.</p> <p>Her heartbeat slows down. We whisper sweet words, hopes and dreams. &quot;We'll be together even if we're far apart&quot;. To which I reply &quot;We'll meet on the other side&quot;. She was getting cold. She asks me if she could wish for one more thing, to hold her in my arms. I press her tightly against me, exchanging her gentle warmth with mine.</p> <p>I tell her &quot;I love you&quot; as she draws her last breath. The heartbeat monitor flatlines. Many needles in her arms with threads leading to various bags of colorful liquid. The doctors rush in. &quot;I'll see you soon&quot; I say with a gentle smile as I caress her and attentively watch over her.</p> </article> </main> <aside class="col-lg-3 blog-sidebar"> <div class="p-5"> <h4>About</h4> <p>Hi!
