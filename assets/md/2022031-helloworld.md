# Hello world

I've been daydreaming alot about making my own blog.
The articles that I would write and upload, the look of it, etc.
But now that I finally have one, I don't know what to write!

I hope to fill it with more articles in the days to come.
What will come of it? We'll see in time.

## Development

My requirements for this website were simple:

- Pages in markedown
- Mobile and desktop friendly
- Hostable on github
- No external databases
- No template generators
- No CDN's

Or in short, a simple blog-like website without relying on third-party services.
Besides, it's not _my_ website if I didn't re-invent the wheel as least once.
I opted for:

- Writing a small router to fetch articles
- `marked` for transforming markdown to html
- `prism` for code highlighting
- `bootstrap` for quickly putting the page together

## Conclusion

You can see the result for yourself, looks pretty neat right?
