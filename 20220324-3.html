To me, this website is my little corner in the near-infinite webway we call the internet. Like styling your own house, I want the design to look and feels good for me to "live in" as it were.</p> <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2> <ul> <li>Comfortable: gentle colors</li> <li>Minimalism: reduce css weight (Kbs) as much as possible</li> <li>Simplicity: only include what I <em>need</em> on there</li> <li>Unique: something fitting for me</li> </ul> <p>With that out of the way, let's dive right in!</p> <h2 id="retro">Retro</h2> <p>After spending a day or so googling various color pallettes and looking through my mother's color pallette book, I found what I was looking for, The colors themselves are probably in the "retro 70s" category, dimmed in vibrance with a more warm accent. It doesn't scream for attention, yet you'll miss it when it's not there. The style reminds me a bit of the colors from games from 1990 - 2005 where simple colors are used with great results, which is fitting as I've played plenty of those games in my childhood.</p> <p><img src="./assets/img/20220324-3/engelwood-crystaldolphin.jpg" alt="img"></p> <p>Another great thing is that my favorite programming language (<code>C</code>) was developed and released by Dennis Richie as well as one of my favorite movies (<code>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</code>) had public screening in the cinema at that time.</p> <h2 id="layout">Layout</h2> <p>I can add in a fanpage for Noelle from Genshin Impact, a gallery of my Escape From Tarkov loadouts, a special webpage with all my MTG deckbuilds on there or a dedicated about me page with great detail on my background, but I don't <em>need</em> any of this for my website. What I really need is a place to show the article, a sidebar with enough information to give people an idea who I am, some links to show off other places and a banner to make the website feel mine.</p> <h2 id="home">Home</h2> <p>Now that everything has been put in place, I can say I'm very happy with the results! I just need to make blockquotes look a bit better, but other than that I'm content with it. In the end, I think I'll didge the dark mode idea as it would require either the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media query (not supported on Internet Explorer 11) or run JS on the webpage to allow for swapping styles, which is an idea I don't like much either.</p> <p>And with that, another problem is resolved hahahaha!</p></div> <div class="col-md-4 p-5 blog-sidebar"> <h4>About</h4> <p>Hi!
