One harder to implement than the other, but all seem like a nice challenge to implement in C with the OOP patterns I described earlier. I'll try to implement some of them in my upcoming series.</p> <h2>But, why?</h2> <p>Because it's an absolute waste of time, even more stupid than the OOP series, but my mind likes a challenge and I long for another pointless experiment to sate my curiosity. Besides, it's a nice benchmark to see if my OOP paradigms are indeed correct.</p> <p>In all honesty, like my OOP articles, I think that emulating OOP in C is a waste of time, but it highlights the costs and complexity behind these systems so maybe there is educational value behind it. I hope no one will use this code in production.</p> <h2>So, what's next?</h2> <p>I'll implement the factory pattern first because I'm very confident in this being possible to emulate, maybe flyweight pattern next, and go from there.</p> </article> </main> <aside class="col-md-4 p-5 blog-sidebar"> <h4>About</h4> <p>Hi!
