# A guide to generic isekai stories

I’ve read way too many isekai (visiting another world) stories in the past
years. Observing trends among them, I wanted to write them down and share these
thoughts. It might be useful at some point for a dungeons and dragons session.

## Timeline

The protagonist is a Japanese salaryman (often IT related) at a “black” company
(aka one that takes very bad care of its employees with lots of overtime and
bullying) or a high school student. Almost always male. Likes otaku things or
plays online MMORPG’s, socially awkweird.

He/she gets to meet god by one of following means:
- Hit by a truck
- Death from overwork
- Death by an incurable decease
- Death while protecting someone or something dear to them
- Reincarnation
- Teleportation

Once arrived in a temporary space, the protagonist meets the god of creation
from the other world or those who summoned him/her.

A variation is that a hero summoning takes place in a country of the other
world. This ritual is forbidden but still executed. Instead of being received
by a god, the protagonist is received by the country's king.

Another variation is that the protagonist was a decendant of the hero and is
kicked out of the current hero party because his/her skills are misunderstood.
However, the current hero party is completely dependent on this person without
realizing it themselves. They way the protagonist get kicked out is with a lot
of verbal abuse from either the current party's leader or a female member.
Miraculously, the gentle submissive girl in the party never speaks up and has
hidden feelings for the protagonist.

The protagonist is given a grand task to set the direction of the story. This
can be:
- Defeat the demon king
- Kill the hero
- Spread knowledge of your old world
- Live to your heart’s content

As well as a set of skills / proficiencies (often called a job) which is
bestowed by the gods. This has to be appraised before the protagonist is aware
of it. Type of job is the following:
- Hero
- Sage
- Adventurer
- Magician
- Healer
- Tamer
- Farmer
- Noble
- Merchant

In addition, the protagonist usually receives restriction and a “cheat skill”
(something that makes him/her overpowered in the world) without being aware of
it.

Restrictions include:
- Always being level n
- Cannot exceed level n
- Has an unknown/low job which citizens people to discriminate
- Is from a race which causes citizens to discriminate

Cheat skills include:
- Unreasonably high proficiency in n
- Unreasonable amount of (high quality) skills
- Bestowment or favors from the gods
- Knowledge from the modern world and can unreasonably translate this to the
  other world

In order for the protagonist to see the stats of him/herself, he/she has to
use the "status" spell. It creates a window visible to the protagonist with
various details. it is always urged to keep it private.

Details include:
- Health (current / maximum amounts)
- Mana (current / maximum amount)
- Magic affinity (light, dark, fire, water, earth, wind)
- Job (tamer, paladin, adventurer, novice, etc)
- Skills obtained (poison resistance, cooking, hand combat, etc)
- Titles (noble, sage, dragon slayer, etc)

There are three ways the protagonist will discover this spell:
- By accident
- By thinking of the world as a game, so they chant the spell
- By being taught about it (by a god, king's underling or family relative)

The other world contains multiple races that peacefully live among each other,
sometimes with a bit of tension from racial difference (culture, looks) but
never in an demeaning manner.

Races include:
- Humans
- Elfs
- Drawfs
- Beastman
- Dragonewts

The world contains an adventurers guild that is not affiliated with any country
and receives request from the locals. These requests have a reward. Job
difficulty ranges from F (beginner) to S tier (nation-threat). One cannot do
quests below their rank. To rank up, the protagonist must either complete a
certain amount of request at his/her level, be recommended by the guild
master of that branch or accomplish a very impressive feat.

There are various types of quests:
- Kill creature/bandits
- Capture creature/bandits
- Collect item/material
- Escort person

Creatures are referred to as one of the following:
- Demon
- Monster
- Beast

Rewards for these quests are in money, natura and services / benefits. Currency
in the world is bronze, silver and gold coins. 1 gold is 100 silver. 1 silver
is 100 bronze. All basic living expenses combined for one day is about 1 silver
coin.

The protagonist is capable of taming or befriending normal and legendary
creatures, even mythical creatures with a detailed history behind it.

In regards to infrastructure, there is also always:
- An inn that provides food and a room to rent (with cute girls of human and
  beastman race)
- A blacksmith for maintaining weapons (ran by dwarfs)
- A pharamacy for procuring medical items (ran by elfs)
- A merchant guild (with fat rich huamns)
- A catholic church (with nuns)
- An orphanage

One of the towns in a country has been inspired of Japanese culture. The
protagonist always feels nostalgic when reaching there, is engrossed by the
food and bathing culture, has to visit an onsen (Japanese public bathing) and
likes to wear Japanese clothes and weaponry. The story behind the town being
this way is because another Japanese men was in the world before them, and
spreaded the culture or was the founder of the town.
