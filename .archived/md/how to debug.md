# Programming: How to debug

## 1. Learn how to use search engines effectively

The most obvious thing that I still see many programmers do wrong; using a
search engine effectively to find help when they have a problem.

Example 1: we want to buy sneakers in Groningen

```txt
Normal:  "I want to buy shoes in Groningen"
Shorter: "buy sneakers groningen".
```

Example 2: C# file not found exception

```txt
Normal:  "An exception occured at L21,C40: File was not found: home/user/..."
Shorter: "C# file not found exception"
```

Notice how the sentences become shorter and more specific. In the first
example, we remove the whole "I want to [..] in" part from the sentence. We
don't want to search with natural text, but keywords. In the second example,
we omit any specific information tied to the project, and only search what's
really relevant (language, exception type).

Shortening sentences to only keywords in itself a form of art, and takes much
practice. It is a skillset that transfers to pretty much all search engines
and is useful for almost any job.

## 2. Learn error messages

Knowing when certain error messages occur means you save time searching, and
it's easier to trace the issue. Sometimes one issue triggers many other (not
very useful) error messages. It's good to know which one is the actual issue.
