# Games: Nice cyberpunk mods

## World

### Cosmopolitan Night City

...

## Items

### StreetStyle

Now you actually have a purpose of wearing clothing that fits a certain style;
StreetStyle adds bonusses to cloths for skill checks, and you can wear the
cloths of a faction to hide yourself in plain sight (as long as you don't
crouch or come too close).

Combine with the mod `Clear Skill Checks` so its easier to see which bonusses
you get from your clothing during conversations and such.

### Toxicity

You can use up to x amount of healing items. After that, you overdose and have
to wait until you can use them again. While overdosed, you have -50% stamina
and take 10% longer to reload

### Enhanced Caft

...

### DLC And Iconic Modifier

...

## Cyberware

### Drone Companions

As an additional operating system cyberware, you can now craft and deploy
drones that you can control. From humanoid to flying drones, to huge mechs.
The deployment grenade items must be crafted.

### Time Dilation Overhaul

Reworks completely how slow-motion works inside the game. Enemies can now enter
slow-motion with you and appear faster if they got the better cyberware. Now
Adam Smasher also has standevistan. Most standevistans have been reworked to
be unique.

### System-EX

Allows you to wear multiple different operating systems / palm cyberware at the
same time.

### Wannabe Edgerunner

Adds the humanity stat and cyberpsychosis for the player into the game. The
more cyberware you equip, the lower your base humanity stat. The higher tier
your cyberware, the less of a burden it is on the humanity stat. If you kill
enemies/civilians or use beserk/standevistan, your humanity decreases too. It
can be restored by a good night rest. You can gain higher base humanity by
removing cyberware. If your humanity stat drops to zero, you get into
cyberpsychosis. Maxtec is after you, your crit change/dmg is reduced but your
health/movement/armor is increased.

Combine with the mod `Legendary Cyberware Collection` to add missing
epic/legendary tier cyberware to the game. In addition. the `Unequip Cyberware`
becomes essential to remove cyberware when you don't need it.

## Combat

### Better netrunning

Instead of watchdog-like hacking, you now first have to breach a network to
be able to use quickhacks on enemies.

You can add `Breach Takedown` to allow breaching during a takedown, making it
possible to breach a network without access points.

### AI Netrunners Enhanced

Normally AI netrunners in the game can only use `Overheat`, which is a damage
quickhack. With this mod, AI netrunners can use many more quickhacks.

This can further be improved with the mod `Amateur Hackers`, which makes
netrunners from a very rare to a more frequent occurance but aren't as powerful
as normal netrunner enemies.

### Vehicle Combat

Not only can you fire weapons inside your bikes and cars, but now there are
also police/gang chases, police/gangs spawns in a block away from you in cars,
and bystanders call the police before getting a warrant.

The mod also works with `Drone Companions` (allowing humanoid mechs to shoot
from the car) and Better Netrunning.

If the police shows up too often, you can add the `Corrupt NCPD` mod to make
the police dissapear at a price based on warranty level.

### Scissors Difficulty Options

Adds multiple options to make the game more difficult or more interesting. For
example, you can remove the artificial burst fire NPCs have which are capable
of full-auto fire.
