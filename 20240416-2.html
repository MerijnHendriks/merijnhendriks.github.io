And I'm the creator of SPTarkov.</p> </blockquote> <p>You might've heard the name of <code>Senko-san</code>, <code>No;Hurry</code> or <code>InNoHurryToCode</code> before if you've been playing the game &quot;Escape From Tarkov&quot; (EFT). Well, that's me!</p> <p>In the past 5 years I've developed, grown and cared for a project close to my heart. In my time of being the project lead and doing most of the work, I grew my open-source project to become popular with an audience worldwide (en/us/cn/ru) and it recieved 1 million downloads in the span of 3 years. Now, it's closer to 3 million and it's still running without me.</p> <p>There are many things I would love to talk about; the history, my principles and philosophy that helped guide the project, the mistakes I've made, among other things. But before I will dive into those things here, I want to start with the most important part to me:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>We didn't realize we were making memories, we just knew we were having fun.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Despite all the dark times I had to go through, it's all been worth it. I don't care for the fame, the impressive download numbers, or honestly even for the accomplishments. It's not why you should do open-source to begin with.</p> <p>To me, the project is the friends I made along the way. The fun I have (had) sharing my nerd interests with others, and the close human connection despite everyone being physicaly located so far away from each other.</p> </article> </main> <aside class="col-lg-3 blog-sidebar"> <div class="p-5"> <h4>About</h4> <p>Hi!
