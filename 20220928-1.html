I've seen them struggle with recent events, which is why I bring this up here.</p> <p>Being born the wrong gender is no joke. The transitioning is a long and very mentally burdening process, the period before is even rougher and afterwards there are many things you cannot use anymore for coping (smoking, drugs, alcohol) nor will you be able to produce children. You have to build a new identity that you didn't had since birth, and have plenty of opposition culturally that gladly make your life rougher. The decision has to be made around 14 or earlier, otherwise your hormones would be out of balance too much to actually successfully transition without looking like frankenstein. Your surroundings has to adapt too and not everyone is willing to accept the change. Those who actually undergo this process is whom I've absolute respect for, and commend for their bravery and will.</p> <p>Recently there is a trend online that's becoming increasingly more popular; to call oneself transgender without ever aiming for or undergoing the transitioning itself. These people reffer to themselves as &quot;trans men&quot; or &quot;trans woman&quot; on social media, usually paired with a statement that they are &quot;trans allies&quot;. These are the same people advocating in the US that transgender is not a disorder (If transgender is a disorder is not for me to say, but not calling it this has implications in the current healthcare system. Needs to be fixed!).</p> <p>In my opinion, this is quite harmful. These posing trans men/woman usually don't do it because they truly want to transition, but because they want pity and attention. Those undergoing the process don't want to be called &quot;trans&quot; nor get pity or attention, they just want to be and reffered to as the other gender and not some sort of flux state. Because transgender is no longer seen as a disorder, people do not receive the medical financial aid they otherwise would've gotten in the US due to how the system works.</p> <p>One thing the Dutch parlement is discussing recently is passing a change in the law that makes it easier for people to change their gender on their passport. I'm in favor of this as this would make it easier for people to experiment if they truly want to live as the other gender. It's a bit odd if you have your trial period by dressing and behaving like the desired gender but the official documents still call you the opposite gender. Chances of abuse is low since a passport is ~70EU a piece, it takes up to two weeks to create and you cannot request another one during this period. Your old one expires as soon as you request a new one, so you cannot swap between two.</p> <p>Hopefully people will understand that being a transgender is not an identity to assign to one's personality but a medical process of transitioning to the correct gender. There is certainly more that could and needs to be done to help those struggling with making the correct decision, and to support them thorough their lives. Calling those who are in the process of or transitioned to the other gender &quot;trans man/woman&quot; is a disservice. Call them &quot;man/woman&quot;.</p> </article> </main> </div> </div> </body> </html>
