The moment it happened I saw it all happen live on my computer screen. The whole week I had a monitor open with live cams so you could monitor and discuss all the things that happened.</p> <p>The whole war reminds me of this song (see Appendix A for lyrics):</p> <p><audio src="./assets/media/20220624-2/ColonelBagshot-SixDaysWar.mp3" controls class="html5-audio-player"> Your browser does not support playing HTML5 audio.

Here is a description of the content: Colonel Bagshot - Six Days War </audio></p> <p>It's terrible to see lives being needlessly be wasted on war, but for Ukraine I can understand why it fights back. You stand to lose everything. Your home, your life, your kids and wife, family friends, <em>everything</em>. No matter if you flee or fight, your future remains uncertain. There is no garuantee on the long run that you live or die regardless of those options.</p> <p>You either flee and be at the mercy of the host country with a bigger chance to live longer without a place to call home or garuantee for permanent residency, in fear of being sent back. Or you die fighting on the battlefield for your values and principles, for your family and fatherland where your body will be buried in the mud without send-off and your loved ones not even aware of your death.</p> <p>The most haunting thing I've seen from the war was two pictures; one was taken 5 days into the invasion. The body of a young Russian soldier bled to death on the ground, and another picture 3 days later where his liveless body was covered in snow, still laying on the battlefield, untouched.</p> <p>Ever since witnessing the war this way, I haven't been playing realistic shooters anymore. Even through I know it's all fictional because it's just a video game on a screen, it's the realization of what war causes. I think it's not something that should be glorified, but I hope that it will remain to be portrayed in video games in the fashion how the Arma series does it.</p> <p>The war serves as a reminder that peace is fragile in this interconnected world, that it was not the wish of the people but politicians. And that war, even here in the Netherlands (which is not providing troops), has concequenses. The collapse of the economy and high inflation from the (claimed) lack of resource drives up prices high. It's going to be tough for me but luckily I had the foresight to save up enough money to get through.</p> <p>I ensure that every day I live is a day I can look back at and say "I'm glad I lived that day", to be and aim for contentness and improvement, not just happiness and stability. So that when I hear I have reached the last of my days, I can look back without regrets.</p> <h2>Appendix A: lyrics</h2> <blockquote class="blockquote blog-blockquote px-3"> <p>At the starting of the week<br> At summit talks you'll hear them speak<br> It's only Monday<br> Negotiations breaking down<br> See those leaders start to frown<br> It's sword and gun day<br> Tomorrow never comes until it's too late<br> You could be sitting taking lunch<br> The news will hit you like a punch<br> It's only Tuesday<br> You never thought we'd go to war<br> After all the things we saw<br> It's April Fools' day<br> Tomorrow never comes until it's too late<br> We'll all go running underground<br> And we'll be listening for the sound<br> It's only Wednesday<br> In your shelter dimly lit<br> Take some wool and learn to knit<br> 'Cause it's a long day<br> Tomorrow never comes until it's too late<br> You'll hear a whistling overhead<br> Are you alive or are you dead?<br> It's only Thursday<br> You feel a shaking of the ground<br> A million candles burn around<br> Is it your birthday?<br> Tomorrow never comes until it's too late<br> Though that shelter is your home<br> The living space you have outgrown<br> It's only Friday<br> As you come out to the light<br> Can your eyes behold the sight<br> It must be doomsday<br> Tomorrow never comes until it's too late<br> Ain't it funny how men think<br> They made the bomb, they are extinct<br> It's only Saturday<br> I think tomorrow's come, I think it's too late<br> I think tomorrow's come, I think it's too late<br> I think tomorrow's come, I think it's too late<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p> <p>-- Colonel Bagshot - Six Days War, 1971</p> </blockquote> </article> </main> <aside class="col-md-4 p-5 blog-sidebar"> <h4>About</h4> <p>Hi!
