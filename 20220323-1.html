There is a whole lot in there that I don't use, so I might as well strip it out. And so, here we are!</p><p>Stripped it all by hand (I'm not proficient with sass/scss compilers) which was an easy task, just takes 2 hours or so (including debugging and releasing). I really like doing this kind of grunt work myself, since its quite relaxing for the brain. I think alot on a day, so this is a good oppertunity for doing something dumb and simple.</p><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p>I went from ~200Kb<code>bootstrap.min.css</code>to my custom uncompressed 6Kb css file that has only the bits I needed. That means that the website went from ~910Kb to a much more comfortable 710Kb in desktop mode. The mobile website went from ~510Kb to 310Kb.</p><p>Sure I could get rid of the banner image and have the page load instantly because of it and I know most people won't care what that banner is gonna look like, but I personally really like the image too much to remove it.</p><h2 id="whatsnext">What's next</h2><p>I do wanna make some quick changes to make adding new pages less work (storing less repeating info in<code>index.json</code>) and then probably see how far I can keep reducing the website size without compromises. Removing a tiny bit more weight can't hurt!</p></div><div class="col-md-4 p-5 blog-sidebar"><h4>About</h4><p>Hi! I'm a Dutch software architect.
