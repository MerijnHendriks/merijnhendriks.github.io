I had plans to write here on new new year's eve, and even before. But I just never got around doing it. In a short amount of time, my world changed substantially.</p> <p>Finally moved out of my parent's place and living on my own for the first time. Then someone made a multiplayer mod for my project, I finally made progress in writing a decent intepreter, finding love, discovering new emotions I haven't felt before and opening up to my friends about very personal things to me for the first time.</p> <p>There is just too much.</p> <p>The longer you hold off from writing, the more difficult it becomes. Somehow I feel like it's becoming a heavier burden when I don't do something often (programming, updating this blog, cleaning my room, etc). It feels paralyzing as the act of writing itself becomes too much.</p> <p>It's hard for me to put this feelings into words. I'm sure you've probably experienced it yourself at some point too.</p> <p>Hopefully with this entry into the blog, it'll be easier for me to write down more things later.</p> </article> </main> <aside class="col-lg-3 blog-sidebar"> <div class="p-5"> <h4>About</h4> <p>Hi!
