# SPTarkov: Intro

> Hi, I'm Merijn. And I'm the creator of SPTarkov.

You might've heard the name of `Senko-san`, `No;Hurry` or `InNoHurryToCode`
before if you've been playing the game "Escape From Tarkov" (EFT). Well, that's
me!

In the past 5 years I've developed, grown and cared for a project close to my
heart. In my time of being the project lead and doing most of the work, I grew
my open-source project to become popular with an audience worldwide
(en/us/cn/ru) and it recieved 1 million downloads in the span of 3 years. Now,
it's closer to 3 million and it's still running without me.

There are many things I would love to talk about; the history, my principles
and philosophy that helped guide the project, the mistakes I've made, among
other things. But before I will dive into those things here, I want to start
with the most important part to me:

> _We didn't realize we were making memories, we just knew we were having fun._

Despite all the dark times I had to go through, it's all been worth it. I don't
care for the fame, the impressive download numbers, or honestly even for the
accomplishments. It's not why you should do open-source to begin with.

To me, the project is the friends I made along the way. The fun I have (had)
sharing my nerd interests with others, and the close human connection despite
everyone being physicaly located so far away from each other.
