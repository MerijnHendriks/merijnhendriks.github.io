# Comfort woman

It's been more than a year since I last wrote. I've been busy with life, but
reading about the experiences of comfort woman prompted me to wrote again. As a
form of processing.

It's no hidden secret to those who know me personally that I adore Japanese
architecture, the language, some of the anime and manga produced there, and
various cultural bits. But the more I read about history outside of surface
level stories, the more I feel conflicted on Japan and my own country.

Roughly once a year in one way or another, I end up on the wikipedia page on
"comfort woman" [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comfort_women), called
"troostmeisje" in Dutch or "ianfu" in Japanese. To summerize it, it's widescale
brutal sexual slavery in asia during the second world war under imperial Japan.

Brutal doesn't do it justice, but I can't find another word. These woman are
tricked into or kidnapped to serve in "comfort stations" (imprisonment camps)
where they are tortured and electrically shocked into submission and raped by
10-20 men a day, 5-10 on the low end and sometimes 30-50.

In Germany, my neighbouring country, their anti-war sentiment and education on
the atrocities means they remember and are less likely to repeat history. In
my country, the Netherlands, formaliy apologized for their history of slavery
in 2022 and made amendments to the people in Java earlier. Sadly I can't find
apology to the treatment of Moluccans, which is shameful in my opinion. In the
Netherlands we're taught both in elementary school and highschool the horrors
of the second world war and slavery, to ensure it isn't erased from public
conscious.

This is where I take issue with Japan; it refuses to formally apologize and
take proper responsibility of it's warcrimes, and refuses to teach their own
citizens of this past. It is far more egregious since there are still former
South Korean and possibly Chinese comfort woman alive to this day, and yet not
given the honours and recognition they deserve.

This also puts Isekai (another world) stories in another perspective. These are
wish-fulfillement stories of being rich, powerful, attractive, living
comfortable lives, be loved, etc in another world or dimention. These stories
often include the purchase of slaves, who then become their partners and
supposedly love them unconditionally through conditioning. The characters feel
morally right to do this as they are "saving" them.

However, as history teaches us, there is no such thing as a happy slave; it is
a life of fear and suffering. The only way to save a slave is to free the and
grant them a place of independence and recognition of their humanity to start
their lives anew.
