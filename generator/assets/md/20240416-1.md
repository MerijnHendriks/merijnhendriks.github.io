# Writer's paralysis

It's been a long time since I wrote here. I had plans to write here on new
new year's eve, and even before. But I just never got around doing it. In a
short amount of time, my world changed substantially.

Finally moved out of my parent's place and living on my own for the first time.
Then someone made a multiplayer mod for my project, I finally made progress in
writing a decent intepreter, finding love, discovering new emotions I haven't
felt before and opening up to my friends about very personal things to me for
the first time.

There is just too much.

The longer you hold off from writing, the more difficult it becomes. Somehow I
feel like it's becoming a heavier burden when I don't do something often 
(programming, updating this blog, cleaning my room, etc). It feels paralyzing
as the act of writing itself becomes too much.

It's hard for me to put this feelings into words. I'm sure you've probably
experienced it yourself at some point too.

Hopefully with this entry into the blog, it'll be easier for me to write down
more things later.
