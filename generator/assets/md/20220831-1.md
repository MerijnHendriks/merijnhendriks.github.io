# Programming: Making VSCode work

After struggling for a long time with trying to make visual studio code
(vscode) work for my use case, I finally got a setup that I'm happy with. Not
just in functionality, but also in look and feel.

My biggest gripe with vscode is how much it's trying to help out without asking
first if I want it at all. Codelens, suggestions, minimap, colored brackets are
to me all very distracting and/or take up screen real-estate that I can use for
displaying more code in the same window. After disabling them, I noticed that I
became more productive from not fighting the editor and being distracted by
menus and suggestions poping up.

What I do really like about vscode is how much I can customize it; it's one of
the best looking text editors with a bit of tweaking. Plugins for added
functionality help out a lot too.

Here's the list of extensions that I use:

- [window theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sveggiani.vscode-field-lights)
- [icon theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jtlowe.vscode-icon-theme)
- [git graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph)
- [hex editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.hexeditor)
- [c/c++ support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd)
- [x86 asm suppport](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=13xforever.language-x86-64-assembly)

It's not a whole lot, but it gets the job done most of the time! And when it
doesn't, I can always install another one or add task bindings so I can work
around the specific issue.
