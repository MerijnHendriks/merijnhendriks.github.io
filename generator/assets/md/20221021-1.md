# Website: Automation

A (relatively) small update for today.

After getting annoying `bad write` errors from nodejs on my pretty heavily
secured windows 10 system and not feeling too happy about having nodejs on my
system at all, I decided to look into github actions to automate publishing of
articles.

I'm not too fond of the yml format nor about human language like configuration
files. It was a bit of a struggle to get github actions to work the way I
wanted to, but I got it to work after experimenting an hour or two.

The result was worth the effort! Now I can just push an article and the updated
index page to the main branch and it will automatically update the website for
me. No longer do I need to manually build before publishing. And most important
of all, there is no longer need for nodejs on my system.
