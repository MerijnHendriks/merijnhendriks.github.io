# OS: Making windows 11 work

I'm pretty biassed towards windows 11. Many things have been a massive pain,
like the massive start menu that lacks almost any form of meaningful
customization. Overall it feels like a big downgrade from windows 10. Sadly at
work I'm forced to use it. There is a project that fixes some of the issues I
have, making windows 11 somewhat usable again.

Valinet's ExplorerPatcher ([link](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher))
allows me to use the windows 10 start menu and cleanup the taskbar from
stuff I don't need. It also can set the taskbar into small mode, which was
notoriously missing in windows 11. Sadly it won't set the icons and sounds back
to windows 10, but I can live with that.
