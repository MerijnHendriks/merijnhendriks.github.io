# C89-DP: Thoughts

There are many design patterns out there, tutorialpoint.com lists close to 40
of them. One harder to implement than the other, but all seem like a nice
challenge to implement in C with the OOP patterns I described earlier. I'll
try to implement some of them in my upcoming series.

## But, why?

Because it's an absolute waste of time, even more stupid than the OOP series,
but my mind likes a challenge and I long for another pointless experiment to
sate my curiosity. Besides, it's a nice benchmark to see if my OOP paradigms
are indeed correct.

In all honesty, like my OOP articles, I think that emulating OOP in C is a
waste of time, but it highlights the costs and complexity behind these systems
so maybe there is educational value behind it. I hope no one will use this code
in production.

## So, what's next?

I'll implement the factory pattern first because I'm very confident in this
being possible to emulate, maybe flyweight pattern next, and go from there.
