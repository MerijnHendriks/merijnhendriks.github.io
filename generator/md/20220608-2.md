# C89-DP: Thoughts

There are many design patterns out there. But, how well would they work in C?
In this upcoming series I'm going to attempt to port some of those design
patterns applied in languages like C++/C#/Java in C89.

## But, why?

Because it's an absolute waste of time, even more stupid, but my mind likes a
challenge and I long for another pointless experiment to keep sate my
curiosity.

## So, what's next?

I'll implement the factory pattern first because I'm very confident in this
being possible to emulate, maybe flyweight pattern next, and go from there.
