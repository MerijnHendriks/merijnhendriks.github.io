# C89-DP: Singleton

This one is gonna be short since there realy isn't much to it.

```c
typedef struct Foo Foo;

struct Foo
{
    int x;
};

Foo* Foo_GetInstance()
{
    static Foo instance = { 0 };
    return &instance;
}
```

```c
Foo* foo = Foo_getInstance();
```

Only thing I need to note is that it's safe to take the reference of `instance`
since it's stored in the static register. Besides that, the rest of the program
works as expected. I could've instead opted for using `extern`, but I think
this looks a little cleaner as I only expose what I want to expose.
