# Goto

For some reason most people I worked with spotted `goto` somewhere, they always overreacted followed by an extistential crisis.
Like with many other programming constructs that these days are frowned upon by the masses (pointers, manual memory allocation), the `goto` statement is very versatile that requires a sensible programmer to write sensible code.
Sadly the older I get, the less people understand what `goto` is and how to use it (effectively).

In many cases we don't need `goto` to emulate control structures since in most (modern) programming languages alternatives exist, but I think it is very useful to know regardless for understanding of the inner workings of the constrol structured we use on a day-to-day basis as well for preserving knowledge; how to write advanced control structures without having modern tools at your disposal.

While I can give the full theory, I always learned more from reading code and poking around with it.
To make things a bit easier, I'll include here full working programs (for C89-compliant compilers) for you to mess with.
It also includes one Java program (for labled breaks) which can be ran with JDK 8.

## While

```c
/* while: keyword */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    int s = 10;

    while (i < s)
    {
        printf("%d", i);
        ++i;
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

```c
/* while: goto */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    int s = 10;

    loop:
        if (i < s)
        {
            printf("%d", i);
            ++i;
            goto loop;
        }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

I think both a very self-explanatory.
Pretty easy to emulate, but having a dedicated `while` control statement is really sweet.
One line less code, clear denotion of scope and easier to read.

## Do-while

```c
/* do-while: keyword */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    int s = 10;

    do
    {
        printf("%d", i);
        ++i;
    }
    while (i < s)

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

```c
/* do-while: goto */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    int s = 10;

    loop:
        printf("%d", i);
        ++i;
        if (i < s) goto loop;

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

To my surprise the `goto` variant is about two lines smaller than the control structure variant, as well as the shortest loop variant in line count (with allman, for otbs its the same).
In addition, it is in my opinion slightly to read as well because it's explicit in code flow.

## Break

```c
/* break: keyword */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int s = 10;

    while (i < s)
    {
        if (j) break;
        printf("%d", i);
        ++i;
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

```c
/* break: goto */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int s = 10;

    while (i < s)
    {
        if (j) goto loop_end;
        printf("%d", i);
        ++i;
    }
    loop_end:

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

The `goto` variant uses one more line of code to no one's suprise.
Those calling the `break` statement "goto in sheep's clothing" would be correct, because it is.

The biggest advantage for the goto variant is that you can break out of multiple loops at once:

```c
/* break outer: goto */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int k = 0;
    int s = 10;

    while (i < s)
    {
        while (j < s)
        {
            if (k) goto loop_end;
            printf("%d", j);
            ++j;
        }

        j = 0;
        ++i;
    }
    loop_end:

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

In modern programming languages they opt to include "labled break", which is really just a goto.
To me it's incredibly stupid.
But hey, to each their own.

```java
// break outer: labeled (java)

class Program
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int k = 0;
        int s = 10;

        loop_end:
            while (i < s)
            {
                while (j < s)
                {
                    if (k == 1) break loop_end;
                    System.out.print(j);
                    ++j;
                }

                j = 0;
                ++i;
            }
    }
}
```

The anti-goto faction might propose this alternative instead:

```c
/* break outer: keyword */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int k = 0;
    int l = 0;
    int s = 10;

    while (i < s)
    {
        if (l) break;

        while (j < s)
        {
            if (k)
            {
                l = 1;
                break;
            };

            printf("%d", j);
            ++j;
        }

        j = 0;
        ++i;
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

...but this introduces a new state, produces more generated code and is slower.
This gets increasingly more complex the more nestled loops exist, and thus not very scalable either.
So overall I would argue that this is a degradation in code quality,

## Continue

```c
/* continue: keyword */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int s = 10;

    while (i < s)
    {
        if (j) continue;
        printf("%d", i);
        ++i;
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

```c
/* continue: goto */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int s = 10;

    loop_begin:
    while (i < s)
    {
        if (j) goto loop_begin;
        printf("%d", i);
        ++i;
    }   

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

Pretty much the same as the `break` statement, but the label is at the top of the loop.
An unique advantage to using `goto` over `continue` means that I can can continue from the outer loop.

```c
/* continue outer: goto */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int k = 0;
    int s = 10;

    loop_begin:
        while (i < s)
        {
            while (j < s)
            {
                if (k) goto loop_begin;
                printf("%d", j);
                ++j;
            }

            j = 0;
            ++i;
        }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

This of course can also be achieved by breaking the inner loop, but this gets increasingly more complex when nestling more than one loop.

```c
/* continue outer: break */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int k = 0;
    int s = 10;

    while (i < s)
    {
        while (j < s)
        {
            if (k) break;
            printf("%d", j);
            ++j;
        }

        j = 0;
        ++i;
    }

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

### Jump table

```c
/* jump table: switch-case */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 0;

    switch (i)
    {
        case 1:
            printf("Case: 1");
            break;

        case 2:
        case 3:
            printf("Case: 2");
            break;

        default:
            printf("Case: none");
            break;
    }

    printf("Switch done");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

```c
/* jump table: goto */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 1;

    if (i == 1) goto case_1;
    if (i == 2) goto case_2;
    if (i == 3) goto case_2;
    goto case_default;
    
    case_1:
        printf("Case: 1");
        goto switch_end;
    
    case_2:
        printf("Case: 2");
        goto switch_end;

    case_default:
        printf("Case: none");
        goto switch_end;

    switch_end:
    
    printf("Switch done");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

The code itself is quite readable, intent is clear and not much harder to understand.
It is however much flatter and more explicit in codeflow whereas switch-case has a clearer denotion of scope.

What suprised me most is that the `goto` variant of the switch-case construct isn't even that much bigger in code length.
It takes ~1 more line (addition of the if-goto) per case, and an additional line for the end label (`switch_end`).

The code of the `goto` variant could've been made shorter to make it match the same amount of lines of code taken to write the switch-case variant.

```c
/* jump table: goto - shorter */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 1;

    if (i == 1) goto case_1;
    if (i == 2) goto case_2;
    if (i == 3) goto case_2;
    
    printf("Case: none");
    goto switch_end;
    
    case_1:
        printf("Case: 1");
        goto switch_end;
    
    case_2:
        printf("Case: 2");

    switch_end:

    printf("Switch done");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

This was achieved by:

- Moving the content of the label `case_default` underneath the if block
- Removing the redundant `goto switch_end` jump

However, I think that the consistency in the previous variant makes it easier to identify what goes on here.

Of course, those with religious believe that `goto` is harmful no matter what would probably argue that this is a better construct in the event that switch-case is not available:

```c
/* jump table: if-else */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    int i = 1;

    if (i == 1)
    {
        printf("Case: 1");
    }
    else if (i == 2 || i == 3)
    {
        printf("Case: 2");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Case: none");
    }

    printf("Switch done");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

...which is valid considering the amount of cases we have, but this quickly gets out of hand when having many statements in your code.

## Cleanup

```c
/* cleanup: if-return */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define ALLOC_SIZE 16

int main()
{
    void *p1 = NULL;
    void *p2 = NULL;
    void *p3 = NULL;

    p1 = malloc(ALLOC_SIZE);
    
    if (!p1)
    {
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    /* use p1 here */

    p2 = malloc(ALLOC_SIZE);

    if (!p2)
    {
        if (p1) free(p1);
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    /* use p2 here */

    p3 = malloc(ALLOC_SIZE);
    
    if (!p3)
    {
        if (p2) free(p2);
        if (p1) free(p1);
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    /* use p3 here */

    if (p3) free(p3);
    if (p2) free(p2);
    if (p1) free(p1);
    
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

```c
/* cleanup: goto */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define ALLOC_SIZE 16

int main()
{
    void *p1 = NULL;
    void *p2 = NULL;
    void *p3 = NULL;

    p1 = malloc(ALLOC_SIZE);
    if (!p1) goto cleanup;

    /* use p1 here */

    p2 = malloc(ALLOC_SIZE);
    if (!p2) goto cleanup;

    /* use p2 here */

    p3 = malloc(ALLOC_SIZE);
    if (!p3) goto cleanup;

    /* use p3 here */

    cleanup:
        if (p3) free(p3);
        if (p2) free(p2);
        if (p1) free(p1);
    
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

While both do the same thing, the `goto` variant is much more concise.
I really can't think of a better way to do this than by using `goto`.

The same technique can be used as an elegant way for error handling, emulating the exception mechanism found in modern languages without the large environment it requires to operate.

Both the if-return and `goto` variant can be written slightly more concise in case allocation is not dependant on the previous ones:

```c
/* cleanup: if-return - shorter */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define ALLOC_SIZE 16

int main()
{
    void *p1 = malloc(ALLOC_SIZE);
    void *p2 = malloc(ALLOC_SIZE);
    void *p3 = malloc(ALLOC_SIZE);
    
    if (!p1 || !p2 || !p3)
    {
        if (p3) free(p3);
        if (p2) free(p2);
        if (p1) free(p1);
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    /* use allocated memory here */

    if (p3) free(p3);
    if (p2) free(p2);
    if (p1) free(p1);
    
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

```c
/* cleanup: goto - shorter */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define ALLOC_SIZE 16

int main()
{
    void *p1 = malloc(ALLOC_SIZE);
    void *p2 = malloc(ALLOC_SIZE);
    void *p3 = malloc(ALLOC_SIZE);

    if (!p1 || !p2 || !p3) goto cleanup;

    /* use allocated memory here */

    cleanup:
        if (p3) free(p3);
        if (p2) free(p2);
        if (p1) free(p1);
    
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

While both are now far simpler, the `goto` variant still has less redundancy because we only have to write the cleanup code once.

## Conclusion

The `goto` statement is a versatile tool that can be used for emulating control flow that does not exist in a language, in addition to use for cleanup and handling errors in a simple yet effective way. If there is something I learned from the journey of exploring goto, its this:

It isn't `goto` that should be considered harmful, but the programmer who doesn't know what he is doing with it.

In the end, we are just craftsman who use the tools available to us for the craft.
A skilled craftsman learns how to use his tools, how to use them for his craft and explores new ways to further his craftsmanship.
A harmful craftsman is one that doesn't understand his tools nor what he is doing and has no capabilities to think for himself.
Turning the tools we yield from steel to rubber doesn't make it any less lethal, it just makes skilled craftsman less effective at the job and harmful craftsman will still find a way to fuck it up.
