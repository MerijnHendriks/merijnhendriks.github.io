# Website optimizations

Today we have the usual case of "I have a brilliant idea when im about to go to sleep".
Sat down, grabbed my laptop, wrote the code, pushed it to git, and here we are.
This time I optimized the banner images, minified both html and css.
But that's not the only thing; I got rid of the `index.json` where I stored all references of the pages.
Instead, it's all automaticallt generated from the filename and markdown header.

Really cool!

The website is now < 300Kb for small displays and < 600Kb for desktop.
If I changed the banner image to a simple vector image, I could get down to ~7Kb(!).
...which I just did!
Loved the Ganyu banner, but it gotta go for a website where I wanna look semi-professional.
Maybe I can make it return when I implement banner overrides for articles.

It's 5:00 AM right now in the Netherlands and I gotta be up at 8:00 AM, so wish me luck.
Will need it...
