# VSCode bloat

Visual Studio Code has something going for it; it has one of the most powerful
features an editor can have; customizable task for automating what you want to.
However, the more I am using VSCode, the more it's getting in my way.

Recently I've been working a bit on html markup for designing physical cards.
All fine and dany, until VSCode keeps inserting `</div>` elements and more that
I didn't ask for. Now I spend my time fighting the editor to insert the right
characters. The same is true for brackets, strings, and more.

Code Lens showing references everywhere is annoying, the file minimap takes too
much space on my 1280x800 screen, and the screen reader (orca) I sometimes use
(I am visually impaired) is absolute garbage on vscode. The fact that I cannot
disable `popular extensions` and the likes nags me too.

In case you wonder, here are my settings:

```json
{
    // disable general editor annoyingness
    "workbench.startupEditor": "none",
    "explorer.confirmDelete": false,
    "explorer.confirmDragAndDrop": false,
    "editor.matchBrackets": "never",

    // disable git trying to be smart
    "git.enableSmartCommit": true,
    "git.confirmSync": false,

    // disable telemetry
    "telemetry.telemetryLevel": "off",
    "workbench.settings.enableNaturalLanguageSearch": false,
    "workbench.enableExperiments": false,
    "update.showReleaseNotes": false,
    "extensions.autoCheckUpdates": false,
    "extensions.autoUpdate": false,
    "update.mode": "none",

    // disable trust
    "security.workspace.trust.enabled": false,

    // disable smart features
    "editor.minimap.enabled": false,
    "editor.codeLens": false,

    // disable intellisense
    "editor.acceptSuggestionOnCommitCharacter": false,
    "editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "off",
    "editor.hover.enabled": false,
    "editor.parameterHints.enabled": false,
    "editor.quickSuggestions": false,
    "editor.quickSuggestionsDelay": 10,
    "editor.suggest.snippetsPreventQuickSuggestions": false,
    "editor.suggestOnTriggerCharacters": false,
    "editor.wordBasedSuggestions": false,

    // disable text insertion
    "editor.autoClosingBrackets": "never",
    "editor.autoClosingDelete": "never",
    "editor.autoClosingOvertype": "never",
    "editor.autoSurround": "never"
}
```

I've tried atom with moderate success with the plugin
`platformio-ide-terminal`, but it's to me a bit too clunky to be used and will
retire soon. TextMate is sadly only for osx, and JetBrains Fleet seems to be
more focussed on web intergration than actual productivity.

It makes me realize that all I really need from my editor is a file panel, my
text editor and a console to type commands in without having to leave the
editor. A programmer should from the top of his/her head what he/she needs,
otherwise just do a quick search in the documentation manual.

I'm switching to gedit now and see how it goes. There is a terminal, files
panel, some simple git intergration, multi-file edit and it isn't based on
chromium so it sounds goods enough.
