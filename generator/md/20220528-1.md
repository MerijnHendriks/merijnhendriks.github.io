# OOP: Polymorphism

This chapter can be quite short because most of it already has been covered in
the `OOP: interface inheritance` article. The concept is the same; we use a VMT
to store all references of virtual methods in there.

## Virtual and override

There isn't much to say here for making virtual methods, as it's exactly the
same as making an interface:

```c
typedef struct Foo_vmt Foo_vmt;
typedef struct Foo Foo;

struct Foo_vmt
{
    void (*add)(Foo* self);
};

struct Foo
{
    Foo_vmt* vptr;
    int x;
};

static void Foo_add(Foo* self)
{
    ++self->x;
}

static Foo_vmt foo_vmt = {
    Foo_add
};

void Foo_ctor(Foo* self, int x)
{
    self->vptr = &foo_vmt;
    self->x = x;
}
```

Inherited classes can override the VMT members of `Foo` by providing their own
implementation of the member. In order to access `Bar`'s fields inside the
`Foo`'s VMT call, we need to downcast `Foo` to `Bar` first.

```c
typedef struct Bar bar;

struct Bar
{
    Foo base;
    Foo_vmt* vptr;
    int y;
};

static void Bar_add(Foo* self)
{
    Bar* bar = (Bar*)self;
    ++bar->x;
    ++bar->y;
}

static Foo_vmt bar_vmt = {
    Bar_add
};

void Bar_ctor(Bar* self, int x, int y)
{
    Foo_ctor(&self->base, x);
    self->base.vptr = &bar_vmt;
    self->y = y;
}
```

You can call the method like this:

```c
Bar bar;
Foo* foo;

Bar_ctor(&bar, 1, 2);
foo = (Foo*)&bar;
bar.base.vptr->add(foo);
```

Note the cast we need to do in order to pass the correct type.

## Abstract methods

To mark a member abstract, simply set the member to `0` so it will throw a
runtime error whenever someone tries to execute it.

```c
static Foo_vmt foo_vmt = {
    0
};
```

## Conclusion

You now know how to make a virtual method, how to override it, and how to make
a method abstract!

Not sure what I want to cover next, maybe how to emulate the `static` keyword
behaviour from C#? Besides design patterns and a statagy for cleanup of classes
in C, I can't think of anything else for the basics. Maybe I could cover macro
(ab)use to emulate generics or how to emulate C# attributes / a simple type
system.

Who knows!
