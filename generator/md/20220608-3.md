# C89-DP: Factory

The goal here is to write a common initializer for multiple classes. In our
case it's not gonna look the same as it would in OOP languages because using
the base type for initializing and accessing the derived data is going to
result in a `segmentation fault`.

## Recap

I'm resuing the `IFoo` and `Foo` from `C89-OOP: interface inheritance`:

```c
typedef struct IFoo IFoo;

struct IFoo
{
    int (*getX)(IFoo* self);
};
```

```c
typedef struct Foo Foo;

struct Foo
{
    IFoo* ifoo;
    int x;
};

static int Foo_getX(IFoo* self)
{
    Foo* foo = (Foo*)self;
    return foo->x;
}

void Foo_ctor(Foo* self, int x)
{
    static IFoo ifoo = {
        Foo_getX
    };

    self->ifoo = &ifoo;
    self->x = x;
}
```

## The factory

Now we get to the fun part! Here we have to setup two things: the id's we need
to signify which instance type we want to create, and a function that actually
produces the instance.

```c
enum FactoryIds
{
    CREATE_FOO = 0
};

void Factory_getFoo(IFoo* result, int id)
{
    switch (id)
    {
        case CREATE_FOO:
            Foo_ctor((Foo*)result, 1);
            return;
    }
}
```

For the sake of preventing this article from becoming really long, I only
included one type to mess with. You can pretty much initialize any class here
as long as it inherits from `IFoo`.

## Usage

```c
Foo foo;
int val;

Factory_getFoo((IFoo*)&foo, CREATE_FOO);
val = foo.ifoo->getX((IFoo*)&foo);
```

## Conclusion

Is it possible? Yup. It might actually even be useful in production because you
can easily set up multiple different data structures with this.
