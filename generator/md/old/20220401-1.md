# Staying (in)sane

We went from climate change to "black lives matters", to a pandemic, to the war on Ukraine.
News went from presenting just factual information to sensational drama.
With every month I feel more and more like one of the few sane people in this world.

Most people don't need to know world politics.
I live in the Netherlands, what good does it bring me for knowing who the Americans elected as president?
Little, because I cannot stop nor prepare for the possible concequences it brings.
Yet I keep getting it shoved in my face no matter where I go.

There is a lot of this bottled up in my brain with no way to get rid of it.
It gives me headaches, can't focus, become unproductive and faster fustrated.
Hopefully throwing it all here in this blog post will give me a way to process all of it.

## Climate change

Gonna keep this one short.
I don't give a hoot if it's real or not, there is too little an invidiual or an household could do regardless.
No issues with solutions as long as there is benefit for me with little downside (for example, sunpanels: steep upfront cost but produce electricity yourself, less dependance on subnet).

As with practically everything, don't push it down my throat.
let me be and make my own findings, I can think for myself.

## BLM

So this whole mess started becoming mainstream when Jorge Floyd died while restrained by a police officer, as a combination of the way he got restrained with drugs he took[^1].
What followed next was "fiery but mostly peaceful protests" where Minneapolis (Minnesoda, United States) was lighten up in flames.

BLM and Antifa called for abolishment of the police[^2].
And when they left, they said the police didn't do their job.
I mean, come on, how short sighted can you be?
It wasn't a surprised to me when the co-founder of the BLM organization says they are trained marxists[^3].

To me this isn't the biggest deal.
None of this I have to deal with, I don't live there.
What I do have an issue with is everyone, their grandma and their dog talking about it as if they were there.
Even worse, we started to see these kind of politics inside the dev tools people use (mostly javascript related to no one's surprise).

- NodeJS had their landing page changed to show it right in your face[^4]
- Typescript turned their website black with a "black lives matter" banner[^5]
  ...but didn't do so for their enterprise visual studio page[^6]
- Electron turned their page black, and still has the "black lives matter" banner to this day[^7]

To me this is pandering, which is highly unprofessional and makes me wanna stay miles away from you.
Needles to say I put quite some effort in replacing the software above with alternatives where possible.

## Pandemic

Just thinking about it wears me out.
From non-medical masks to restrictions to curfews to lockdowns where you couldn't leave the house to the corona passport.
There is just too much that could've been done much better if people didn't overreact and used their head.
What's past is past, but I will not forget.

## War on Ukraine

Terrible what happens there, especially hearing both sides of the story (from my Russian and Ukrainian friends).
The citizens of both nations didn't want this war, and understand its completely on Putin and his friends.
There is a reason why Ukraine and Russia were called "brother nations".

It was surreal to see live how the invasion happened, to watch how people were murdered and defend themselves for their own survival.
Far more news on the topic than usual, yet very little factual information.

One thing we'll know for sure:

> "The war will end. The leaders will shake hands. The old women will keep waiting for her martyred son. That girl will wait for her beloved husband. And those children will wait for their heroic father. I don't know who sold our homeland. But I saw who paid the price."

## Regarding programming

Politics **DO NOT** belong in development of software in any shape or form.
As long as you don't get into your private life (gender, sexual orientation, politics, etc) or make politically-motivated changes to the software, I can work with you.
