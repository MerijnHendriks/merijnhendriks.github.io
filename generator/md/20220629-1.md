# Website: Small update

Not much to note today, so this will be a smaller entry.

While going through the pages of my website to review the contents, I noticed
that the lyrics in the `War` article had a lot of spacing at the end. After a
bit of debugging, `markdown-it` showed the right html output, meaning that
`linkedom` was doing some weird stuff. Migrating back to `jsdom` revealed that
this was indeed the case. Back to `jsdom` for the time being.

I've also taken the time to fix the spacing in the `.css` files, simplify the
generator even more and improve the styling of the website just a bit. It
finally got nice looking blockquotes. The sidebar is painted light gray again
because the sand-ish color was a bit too jarring with the rest of the website
and removes focus from the content.

Been thinking for a while how I could change the styling of the website to a
dark theme, but so far I couldn't find any nice color scheme that fits the
bill. Hopefully when `bootstrap` 5.2.0 comes out I can get something that would
be suitable for the website.
