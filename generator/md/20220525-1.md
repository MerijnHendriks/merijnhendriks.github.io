# Hello, world! (again)

After thinking for a while and looking through this blog's content, I decided to
archive all the old posts and start over. I wasn't satisfied with the overall
quality of the posts. I do keep a backup copy of them in case I want to restore
them later.

What I'll do for now is rewrite the goto and oop inheritance in C89 articles and
rework them until I'm satisfied. Then, I'll probably write more on emulating
other parts of oop languages features and patterns in C89.

...and probably some personal stuff from time to time, we'll see!
