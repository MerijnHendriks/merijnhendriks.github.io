To my suprise, there was one: EmuTarkov.</p> <p>It was developed by Polivilas since ~2018 and publicly released at 2019-02-26. Designed as a cheating sandbox to safely develop cheats without getting banned, all it could really do was get you into a raid with a fixed profile. BALIST0N was an avid player of the game since 0.2 and contributed some code as well for making bots able to spawn and being able to buy items. I honestly didn't need more than that myself, I just wanted to dress-up my character in cool looking ways and shoot some scavs to get som sweet payback.</p> <p>The project was written in the by me dreaded language; JavaScript (ES5). I'm a trained Unity game developer and I knew a thing or two about C89 / C++98 / .NET Framework 2.0. But JS? God it was an awful language! It did however make the barrier of entry easy (theoretically) because it's a scripting language; easy to pick up.</p> <p>...that was until I saw the source. It was one big JS file of over 1000 lines of <strong>MUTATED shared state</strong>. In the course of the next month, it was haunting me during every lecture; I <em>had</em> to rewrite that!</p> <p>On the good evening of 2019-05-29 I got myself wasted enough to read the source in full and made my first commit at 2019-05-30. Starting in June, I refactored most of the code to remove shared state and rework the internals to make development simpler and faster. I also started to bundle the code with NodeJS so users could just download &amp; play.</p> <p>At the end of June (2019-06-20), TheMaoci made a post on the issue board to ask Polivilas, BALIST0N and me to join a Discord server (chat group) so we could collaborate in realtime. While Polivilas declined, BALIST0N and I joined.</p> <p>Little did we know that this was the beginning of a new era.</p> <p>The last version released was <code>0.4.1</code>, all versions were made for EFT 0.11.7.3333.</p> </article> </main> <aside class="col-lg-3 blog-sidebar"> <div class="p-5"> <h4>About</h4> <p>Hi!
