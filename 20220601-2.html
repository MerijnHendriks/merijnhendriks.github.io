I'm a Dutch programmer with a love for hamburgers and sake nigiri. When I'm not programming all day, you can find me reading manga, playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat or D&amp;D5E / MTG with friends.</p> <h4>Links</h4> <ul> <li><a href="https://www.github.com/merijnhendriks">Github</a></li><li><a href="mailto:me@nohurry.moe">Email</a></li><li><a href="https://nohurry.moe/feed.rss">RSS</a></li> </ul> </div> </aside> <main class="col-md-9 p-5 offset-md-3 blog-main"> <article class="blog-content"><h1>Website: Creation</h1> <p>We live in the age of the corporate internet. Most pages are related to news from large news organizations, social media websites tracking your every move, many webstores and a whole lot of junk websites.</p> <p>Today's web is bloated beyond comprehension: Huge banners, large images, a lot of wasted words, cookies, many server requests, loads and loads of javascript that no one needs, lots of trackers too.</p> <p>The original internet wasn't this; it was a medium to share information and exchange knowledge. To have your own unique constructed space in the vast digital ocean.</p> <p>With this blog I want to reconstruct what the internet stood for.</p> <h2>Requirements</h2> <p>I wanted something simple that could scale for a host of devices. My primary targets are mobile phones and desktop browsers. The target browser for feature support is Internet Explorer 11. My target website size is simple; it need to be transferrable in one go by a 56k modem. Since I don't want my website to use javascript, my only real option is to go for prerendering everything.</p> <p>The purpose of the website itself was clear: I wanted it to be a small blog for me to write for. The content on it is mostly programming related, but sometimes also some personal stuff from time to time.</p> <p>Since I don't like writing html by hand, I decided I would use markdown for my articles and have those translated to html at some point. Code highlighting is another thing I really wanted because the code is so much nicer to read that way at a relative low price in size.</p> <p>All of those rules forced me to go for a simple non-bloated design.</p> <h2>Putting it together</h2> <p>I decided that using <code>bootstrap 5</code> and stripping it down to the bare minimum was the best course of action for basic theming. They got the scalability right and stripping it down means I don't have to serve 260KB of css.</p> <p>For code highlighting I went with <code>prism</code> since <code>shiki</code> embeds the color inside the html, which means more to serve overall. <code>Highlightjs</code> doesn't support all my use-cases.</p> <p>First I went for <code>showdown</code> to generate md to html as it supported all my use-cases at first, but I've replaced it now with <code>markdown-it</code>.</p> <p>To lower the size of the website as much as possible, I minify the html, and bundle + minify the css files using <code>html-minifier</code> and <code>cleancss</code>. That means less requests and less redundant data to transfer to the browser.</p> <p>At last I had to write a static website generator to combine it all together. I opted for writing the whole thing using <code>jsdom</code> to get a browser-like syntax for manipulating the html code. I tried writing it using <code>vite-plugin-ssr</code> but the whole website was far more bloated with than without, in addition to not being able to debug the website without a web server running.</p> <h2>Result</h2> <p>I'm pretty happy with it! I only have to write an article and press the <code>build</code> button to get everything just the way I want it to be. Maybe I could look into replacing <code>jsdom</code> with a more lightweight alternative, but it works good enough for now.</p> </article> </main> </div> </div> </body></html>
